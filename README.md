# Voice-And-Gesture-Controlled-Smart-LED-System

## Overview

This project focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a smart contactless lighting control system integrating Voice Recognition, Gesture Recognition, and IoT-based remote monitoring. The system is built around the ESP32 NodeMCU platform and combines Edge AI processing with embedded hardware control to deliver a responsive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for modern smart environments.

The system supports:
- Voice-controlled lighting using an embedded AI model.
- Gesture-based interaction using optical motion sensing.
- Real-time Web App monitoring and control via Socket.IO.
- High-power LED actuation through isolated relay switching.
- RGB LED visual feedback for system status indication.
